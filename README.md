1) Data cleaning: This is the process of preparing our data for analysis by removing or correcting errors, inconsistencies, outliers, duplicates, missing values, and irrelevant information. We can use various Excel functions and features to clean our data, such as TRIM, PROPER, FIND, REPLACE, IFERROR, FILTER, SORT, REMOVE DUPLICATES, and DATA VALIDATION.

2) Data processing: This is the process of transforming our data into a suitable format for analysis by applying calculations, formulas, functions, and operations. We can use Excel to perform various data processing tasks, such as SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, MIN, MAX, VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, INDEX, MATCH, IF, AND, OR, NOT, and TEXT.

3)Data analysis: This is the process of exploring our data to discover patterns, trends, relationships, correlations, causations, and insights. We can use Excel to perform various data analysis techniques, such as PIVOT TABLES, PIVOT CHARTS, SLICERS, TIMELINE FILTERS, DATA ANALYSIS TOOLPAK, GOAL SEEK, SCENARIO MANAGER, and SOLVER. Based on the sample insights, you can use pivot tables and charts to calculate the percentage of online purchases by gender, age group, state, and channel. You can also use slicers and timeline filters to filter the data by different criteria. You can also use regression analysis to forecast future sales and identify key factors affecting sales performance.

4) Data visualization: This is the process of presenting our data in a graphical or pictorial form to communicate our findings and recommendations effectively. We can use Excel to create various types of data visualizations, such as BAR CHARTS, LINE CHARTS, PIE CHARTS, SCATTER PLOTS, HISTOGRAMS, BOX PLOTS, and DASHBOARDS. Based on the final conclusion, you can create a dashboard that shows the target segment of customers (women aged 30-49 years living in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh) and the ads, offers, or coupons available on Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra. You can also use conditional formatting to highlight the best-performing products or regions.

This project analyzes the online shopping behaviour of customers in India and suggests a strategy to increase Silver store sales. The project uses Excel to find that women aged 30-49 years are the most likely to buy online, especially from Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra. The project also finds that Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh have the highest online sales. Based on these findings, the project recommends targeting women customers of age group (30-49 years) living in these states by showing them ads, offers, or coupons available on these channels.
